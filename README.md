## Technologies

i ported my last build into a Next.Js enviornment and still utilized SASS for layout and design.

i am currently looking into adding mongoose in order to handle a download function of pdfs, mainly to hold my resum√©.

also am wanting to set up a dark mode as well. design ideas can be seen below:
